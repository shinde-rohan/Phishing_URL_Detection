Project aimed to protect users from phishing websites by identifying and alerting them to potential threats, as well as blocking ads through the use of a tool such as pi-hole. Through our work, we found that our phishing website identification and alert system was effective in detecting and warning users about potential threats, while the use of pi-hole significantly reduced the risk of users being exposed to malicious ads that could lead to phishing attacks.
